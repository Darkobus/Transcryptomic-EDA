# Transcryptomic-EDA
Reconnaissance and a set of technologies for creating a simple model analyzing transcriptomic analyses from cellular and animal models

1. Cleaning current database
2. Conducting deep EDA, visualizations, PCA, UMAP, boxplots etc
3. DEG, class selection etc
4. Considering model - for now my shot is KNN, but who knows...
5. Picking best model for this taks
6. End-to-End pipeline with cleaning etc
